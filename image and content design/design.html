				<p>John Felix Anthony Cena (/ˈsiːnə/ SEE-nə; born April 23, 1977) is an American professional wrestler, actor, and former rapper. As a wrestler, he has been signed to WWE since 2001, but has been performing part-time since 2018. A record 16-time world champion as recognized by WWE,[a] Cena is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time.[8][9][10][11][12][13]

Cena moved to California in 1998 to pursue a career as a bodybuilder and switched to professional wrestling in 1999, and made his debut for Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW). In 2001, he signed with the then-World Wrestling Federation (WWF; renamed WWE in 2002) and was assigned to its developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), winning the OVW Heavyweight Championship and OVW Southern Tag Team Championship.[14][15] After moving up to WWE's main roster on SmackDown in 2002, Cena gained fame and success after adopting the character of a trash-talking rapper.[16][17] After winning his first WWE Championship in 2005, Cena transitioned into a clean-cut, heroic character which he described as a "goody-two shoes Superman".[18] He led the company as its franchise player[19] and public face from the mid-2000s to the late 2010s.[20]</p>
